        <h3>Who is the course instructor</h3>
        <p>Trevor</p>

        <h3>Who is your class tutor</h3>
        <p>Trevor</p>

        <h3>Have you any programming or web design experience?</h3>
        <p>I have some experience in programming and web design through my previous role as an Event Coordinator. My role as an Event Coordinator gave me my first introduction to the world of Programming and Web Design with a predominant part of my job being designing conference web pages. This introduction to the world of HTML and CSS is what drew me into studying IT, alongside the COVID pandemic shutting down events and giving me time to explore this interest.</p>

        <h3>Do you see yourself as a programmer, designer, or both?</h3>
        <p>At this stage I see myself as more of a designer, with an interest in becoming more of a programmer. I love learning new skills particularly when it comes to programming languages so I hope to better refine my skills through this course.</p>

        <h3>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</h3>
        <p>Through my previous career in Event Management I delved a little bit into the world of IT and as mentioned earlier this sparked an interest in this area. When the COVID pandemic hit, events were off the table and I was already looking to change careers so I enrolled in a Bachelor of IT, which has eventually led me to this course.</p>

        <h3>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</h3>
        <p>I am hoping to develop my knowledge of the coding languages explored in this course further as well as learn more about how they can be linked to create beautiful and dynamic web pages. I also want to gain more confidence in my programming ability so I can put my hand up in the future for the coding aspect of projects rather than just focusing on admin work because its my comfort zone.</p>

        <h3>What websites do you use the most?</h3>
        <p>I am a big movie/tv show buff so definitely websites like Netflix, Stan etc, otherwise I don't tend to have any other go to's but rather like everyone will use webpages as a source of information, I am one of those people that Googles everything.</p>

        <h3>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</h3>
        <p>I have a few hobbies including; Gaming, both board games and video games, going for walks, watching TV shows and movies and anything crafty.</p>
